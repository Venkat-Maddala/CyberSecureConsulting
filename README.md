# CyberSecureConsulting (Simulated Organization Lab)

**Author:** Venkat Maddala  
**Goal:** Build a complete end-to-end simulation of a cybersecurity consulting company that replicates real-world enterprise operations — including Red Team, Blue Team, SOC workflows, Identity & Privileged Access Management — all documented for recruiters and security professionals.

## 📌 About This Project
This is a **self-built enterprise simulation** designed to:
- Mimic the infrastructure and operations of a consulting company (similar to TCS/Wipro).
- Include **both Red Team & Blue Team** activities.
- Demonstrate **hands-on expertise** in:
  - Identity & Access Management
  - Privileged Access Management (PAM)
  - SOC Operations
  - Threat Hunting
  - Incident Response
  - Detection Engineering

All work here is **documented step-by-step** so recruiters can see my depth of knowledge and ability to execute real-world tasks.
